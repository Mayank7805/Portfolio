# Personal Portfolio Website

A modern, responsive personal portfolio website built using React (Vite) and Tailwind CSS.  
This project showcases my work, technical skills, and projects in a clean, structured, and professional interface designed for recruiters, collaborators, and industry professionals.

The website focuses on strong typography, balanced spacing, and a minimal dark theme to create a confident and distraction-free user experience. It is fully responsive and optimized for both desktop and mobile devices.
